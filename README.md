# Data_Science_Projects

**Data_Science_Projects** is a repo where I will post my projects in the field of Data Science. Most of the projects are Kaggle competitions, where I will perform EDA and go through some of the most basic scikit-learn models. The projects are not made in a way to pay much attention to the result achieved on the leaderboard, as much as they will serve to show my understanding of the most common Data Science concepts used in it.
